### Prograss

#### CIFAR-10

* resnet-20 [TESTING]
* resnet-56 [TO DO]
* resnet-110 [TO DO]

#### ImageNet

* resnet-50 [TESTING]
* resnet-101 [TO DO]
* resnet-152 [TO DO]

### Specification

Different from the [paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385), Resnet20 is now using the bottleneck structure in this implementation, this will be corrected in the future.

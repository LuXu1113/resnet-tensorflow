### Introduction

Written for learning Resnet and tensorflow. Based on python-3.6 and tensorflow-1.0.

### Reference

1. [Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385)
2. [deep-residual-networs](https://github.com/KaimingHe/deep-residual-networks)
3. [tensorflow-api-docs](http://www.tensorfly.cn/tfdoc/api_docs/index.html)

### Prograss

#### CIFAR-10

* resnet-20 [TESTING]
* resnet-56 [TO DO]
* resnet-110 [TO DO]

#### ImageNet

* resnet-50 [TESTING]
* resnet-101 [TO DO]
* resnet-152 [TO DO]

### Specifications

* In this implementation, projection shortcuts are used for increasing deminsions, and other shortcuts are identity, which is mentioned in the [paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) as option B.

### Results

### Models

* Visualizations of network structures (draw by tensorboard)
